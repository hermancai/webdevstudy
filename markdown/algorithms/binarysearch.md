<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/description" target="_blank">Search Insert Position</a> (Easy)

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

Write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**answer**

```py
# Time complexity: O(log n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
def searchInsert(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        if nums[mid] > target:
            end = mid - 1
        else:
            start = mid + 1

    # Start will be equivalent to mid or mid + 1 for insert position
    return start
```

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/description" target="_blank">Search a 2D Matrix</a> (Medium)

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

-   Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
-   The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` if `target` is in matrix or `false` otherwise.

Write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.

**answer**

```py
# Time complexity: O(log(m * n))
# Space complexity: O(1)
def searchMatrix(matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
    # Binary search to find row containing target
    start, end = 0, len(matrix) - 1
    inRow = -1
    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if matrix[mid][0] > target:
            end = mid - 1
        elif matrix[mid][-1] < target:
            start = mid + 1
        else:
            inRow = mid
            break
    if inRow == -1:
        return False

    # Binary search to find target in row
    start, end = 0, len(matrix[0])
    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if matrix[inRow][mid] == target:
            return True
        elif matrix[inRow][mid] > target:
            end = mid - 1
        else:
            start = mid + 1
    return False
```

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description" target="_blank">Find Peak Element</a> (Medium)

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

Assume `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

Assume `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

Write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**answer**

```py
# Time complexity: O(log n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
def findPeakElement(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    # Check ends of list now to prevent boundary checks later
    if len(nums) == 1 or nums[0] > nums[1]:
        return 0
    if nums[-1] > nums[-2]:
        return len(nums) - 1

    start, end = 1, len(nums) - 2
    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[mid - 1] and nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
            return mid
        # A peak is guaranteed to exist on the side that is higher,
        #   either as a normal peak with two neighbors, or the end of the list.
        elif nums[mid] < nums[mid - 1]:
            end = mid - 1
        else:
            start = mid + 1
```

**question**

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description" target="_blank">Search in Rotated Sorted Array</a> (Medium)

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (0-indexed). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not in `nums`.

Write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**answer**

```py
# Time complexity: O(log n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
def search(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid

        # Logic: at most only one side is rotated
        # If left side is not rotated
        if nums[start] <= nums[mid]:  # Must use <= in case start == mid
            if nums[start] <= target <= nums[mid]:
                end = mid - 1
            else:
                start = mid + 1
        # Else right side is not rotated
        else:
            if nums[mid] <= target <= nums[end]:
                start = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid - 1

    return -1
```

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value.

If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

Write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**answer**

```py
# Time complexity: O(log n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
def searchRange(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    answer = [-1, -1]

    # Two binary searches to find first and last index
    # Instead of stopping search when target found, keeping going

    start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            answer[0] = mid

        if nums[mid] >= target:

    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            answer[1] = mid

        if nums[mid] <= target:

    return answer
```
